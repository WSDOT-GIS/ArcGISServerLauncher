# ArcGIS Server Launcher #
This is an HTML5 application that aids in managing multiple ArcGIS Servers by providing links for the servers' REST endpoint, REST Admin and Manager.

## Demo ##
To try this application go to http://wsdot-gis.github.com/ArcGISServerLauncher/

## Usage ##
1. Type the URL of the REST endpoint of an ArcGIS Server.  If the server follows the default naming convention, you can just type the name of the server.
2. Click the "Add Server" button.  
	A new list item will be created for this server and saved in the browser's local storage.  This means that the next time you come to the page you will not have to re-enter the servers.
3. If you want to remove a server from the list, click the "remove" link.
